Bash Libraries
--------------

This project host a bunch of bash libraries created by myself.

+ lib-git.sh: git methods like `getNumberOfUntrackedFiles` or `checkIfTagExists`
+ lib-gitlab.sh: library to use gitlab api.
+ lib-log.sh: ANSI color logging
+ lib-memcache.sh: simple client for memcache
+ aws/lib-aws.sh includes all the below files:
  + aws/lib-aws-apigateway.sh aws api gateway helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-dynamodb.sh dynamo db helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-ec2.sh ec2 helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-iam.sh iam helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-ec2.sh s3 helper methods

The libraries are very incomplete, they are in continous evolution and I add methods when I need them
