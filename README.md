Bash Libraries
--------------

This project host a bunch of bash libraries created by myself.

+ lib-git.sh: git methods like `git-get-number-of-untracked-files` or `git-check-if-tag-exists`
+ lib-gitlab.sh: library to use gitlab api.
+ lib-log.sh: ANSI color logging
+ lib-memcache.sh: simple client for memcache
+ lib-jenkins.sh: jenkins-cli.jar wrapper to interact with Jenkins API
+ aws/lib-aws.sh includes all the below files:
  + aws/lib-aws-apigateway.sh aws api gateway helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-dynamodb.sh dynamo db helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-ec2.sh ec2 helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-iam.sh iam helper methods
  + aws/lib-aws-s3.sh s3 helper methods

The libraries are very incomplete, they are in continous evolution and I add methods when I need them.
